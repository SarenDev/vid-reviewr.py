## vid-reviewr.py

__*The script lets you go throught the directory and choose which videos to leave and which to delete.*__

**It might sound interesting already, but there are some extra features:**

* *Autosave*, to never lose progress if the app (or you) quits
* *Normal save*, so that you don't have to go through a directory all over again; Instead, just look at the new files
* *Somewhat useful launcher*, for those who want to run it as it was intended
* *That's basically it*... so far! Improvements to become available, maybe

This is a first project type of deal, so quality isn't a guarantee... but then again, when is it ever?
